PSX Lander (alpha)

Simple PSX retro-game with that cool 2D vector look. Mostly 'cos I haven't got the GTE figured out yet.

Upoad the NTSC or PAL version, depending on your console. Or just run it on an PSEmuPro.


Object: Land your asteroids-style ship on the surface of the moon (or whatever you would like to imagine it to be). Land only on the landing pad. Don't land too hard or too skew.

Controls: Rotate your ship with the D-pad left and right. Thrust with the X button. Autodestruct (???) with the [] button. When you have landed or crashed, proceed to the next moon with the triangle button.

Press START button to start the game when on the title screen. If you hold down the X button when starting, you get stronger gravity, which makes landing a bit more difficult.


Look forward to an improved version with sound and stuff when I get my sound libs properly tested!

Hope it brings a little smile to your face and a little joy to the world. :)
