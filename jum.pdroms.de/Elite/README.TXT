Elite Demo
~~~~~~~~~~

By Jum Hig 1999

This is my second PSX demo, programmed using mipsgcc, Rob Withey's PSX library, and my PSX sound library.

It hasn't been tested on a real PSX, since I don't have one at the moment :{ , but it runs fine on PSEmuPro.

Please excuse the crappy MOD.

Upload it however you can.

Source included.
