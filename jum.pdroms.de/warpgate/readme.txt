Warpgate PSX
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A demo game by James Higgs (aka Jum), programmed
specially for the Lik-Sang y2kode console
programming competition (www.y2kode.com).



Platform:   Playstation

Dev System: Caetla + Xplorer V2 + link cable + PC.
            
Dev Tools:  GNU C for MIPS (mipsgcc)
            Homebrew libraries.
            PSP, Goldwave.



Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Warpgate is a "Defender" style game for the PSX.
At the moment it's still an alpha version - many
features have been omitted in order to meet the
competition deadline.

I chose this style of game because I wanted to
code a complete game, so it had to be simple so
that I could make the deadline.

Well it turns out that sometimes games that look
simple, sometimes aren't :)

Take a look at the text file in this distriution
called "analysis.txt", to see how the game is
built.



How To Run The Game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The game is contained in 1 PSX executable file.
It can be uploaded to a PSX and run by using
Caetla, eg:

> psexe wg


Or it can be burnt to a CDR (you will have 
create your own CD boot files, though).



Controls
~~~~~~~~

Once the game is running, it will cycle through
the title screen, story screen, hiscore screen
and credits screen.

Press START to start a new game.
Press X to fire lasers.
Press O for smart bomb.



How to Play the Game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Shoot everything except the humans. Protect
the humanoids from being abducted by the alien
ships. Try not to get hit by an alien bullet.

The different alien ships behave differently,
so you will have to learn their behaviours
if you want to survive. But here are two tips
that will keep you alive longer:

1. Save your smart bombs for when you have to
   shoot the pods.

2. Try not to follow behind an alien ship -
   it will have more chance to shoot at you.

There are 8 levels in the game - if you
make it past level 4 you're doing well.

Oh and have fun!



Future
~~~~~~

Well this game is not finished. Extra alien
types, motherships, invincibility pods,
bonus waves, etc etc are all ideas that
still need to be implemented. If you have
any good ideas or comments, email me.
