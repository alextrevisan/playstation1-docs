Jum's 1st PSX Intro
June 1999

Instructions:

Upload mydemo1.psx to your PSX, or load it into your favourite
emulator.

No other files need to be loaded first.

Sit back and watch. Hopefully it works. If it doesn't, email me and
give infos.


Thanks and greetz to Rob Withey (PSX library [where's the sound lib,
man?]) and of course the ubiquitous Napalm site and Hitmen site for
all the docs and utils and inspiration.

Do you got a license for that mind?
